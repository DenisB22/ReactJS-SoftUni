Congratulations on the arrival of your new furry friend! Bringing a puppy into your home is a big responsibility, but it's also an incredibly rewarding experience. One of the first things you'll want to do is start training your new pup, and it's important to do so early on to set the stage for a well-behaved dog in the future. But where do you start?

## Choose a Training Method
First things first, choose a training method that aligns with your values and goals. There are many different approaches to training, from positive reinforcement to more punishment-based methods. Consider what you want to achieve with your training and choose a method that feels comfortable and effective for you.

## Decide on a Training Schedule
Next, decide on a training schedule. Puppies have short attention spans, so it's best to keep training sessions short and sweet.

## Set a Training Frequency
Start with five to ten minute sessions several times a day, and gradually increase the length as your puppy gets older. Keep in mind that puppies have a lot of energy, so it's important to provide plenty of physical and mental stimulation through play, walks, and training

## Basic Commands
Now it's time to choose some basic commands to work on. "Sit," "stay," and "come" are great starters, as they can be useful in a variety of situations. Start with one command at a time, and use treats and praise to reinforce good behavior. As your puppy starts to understand the commands, gradually fade out the treats and rely more on praise.

## Set Boundaries and Rules
It's also important to set boundaries and rules for your puppy from the start. Decide on a designated spot for your puppy to relieve themselves, and establish rules for where they are and aren't allowed to go in the house. Consistency is key, so make sure everyone in the household is on the same page when it comes to enforcing the rules.

Training your new puppy can be a lot of work, but it's also a lot of fun! Just be patient, stay consistent, and above all, have a good sense of humor. After all, puppies are bound to get into a bit of mischief now and then. Happy training!
